# PrometheusGrafana
A guide to set up and install prometheus and grafana locally.

This guide is divided into two parts; automatically setting up and installing everything, and installing everything manually with understanding of how each component work. It is up to the user as to which approach to follow.

A sample python file demonstrating the setting up of gauge metrics, and starting http server, and a prometheus configuration file is provided along with this documentation.
